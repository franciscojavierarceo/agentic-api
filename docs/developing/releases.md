# Releasing Agentic API

Releases are deliberate maintainer actions. Merging a PR does **not** publish to PyPI or crates.io.
Relevant PRs, merge-queue entries, and pushes to `main` build and validate Python release wheels automatically;
publication requires a separate manual dispatch.

The workflow files are the source of truth:

| Workflow | Purpose | Default / inputs | Publishes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Prepare release PR](https://github.com/vllm-project/agentic-api/actions/workflows/prepare-release-pr.yml) | Open the version-bump PR | Required `version` | Nothing |
| [Release crates](https://github.com/vllm-project/agentic-api/actions/workflows/release-crates.yml) | Validate or publish Rust packages | `dry_run=true`; required `version` | With `dry_run=false`: crates, Git tag, GitHub release; then deploys the website |
| [Release Python](https://github.com/vllm-project/agentic-api/actions/workflows/release-python.yml) | Build and validate all release wheels | `publish=false`; no version input | With `publish=true`: PyPI wheels after all builds pass |

There is no automatic handoff from crates publishing to PyPI publishing. Dispatch both for a release of both
distributions. All publication runs must use `main`; Python build-only validation can run on a branch.

## Credentials and permissions

- **Release preparation and crates:** the workflows require the triggering GitHub user to have `maintain` or `admin`
  repository permission. Repository Actions settings and branch/tag rules must allow the workflow to create its
  release branch, PR, tag, and GitHub release.
- **crates.io:** configure the repository Actions secret `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` with a crates.io token authorized to
  publish `agentic-server-core` and `agentic-server`. Publishing uses this token; a dry run does not upload packages.
- **PyPI:** configure a [Trusted Publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/) on the
  `agentic-api` project with owner `vllm-project`, repository `agentic-api`, workflow filename `release-python.yml`,
  and environment `pypi`. The GitHub environment must also be named `pypi`; complete any configured environment
  approval before the publishing job can run. No PyPI API-token secret is used. Only the publishing job has
  `id-token: write` permission.

These are configuration requirements, not confirmation that a token or publisher is currently valid. A build-only
run verifies packaging and tests, but does not exercise registry upload authorization. TestPyPI is not configured.

## 1. Prepare the version

Choose an unused version. `[workspace.package].version` in `Cargo.toml` is the source of truth; the workspace's
`agentic-core` dependency version and workspace package entries in `Cargo.lock` must agree. Python declares a dynamic
version in `pyproject.toml`; Maturin derives it from the Rust package, and `agentic_api.__version__` reads installed
package metadata. Do not add a separate Python version or a fallback release version.

In GitHub, open **Actions → Prepare release PR → Run workflow**, select `main`, and enter the new `version` without
a `v` prefix. This updates `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, runs Rust checks, and opens `release-prep/v<VERSION>` against
`main`. It fails if that branch already exists; inspect the existing PR before trying again.

The equivalent CLI command, from this repository, is:

```bash
# Example only: choose a version not already published.
release_version=0.7.1
gh workflow run prepare-release-pr.yml --ref main -f version="$release_version"
```

Review the diff and wait for required CI, including the three-platform Python release matrix. Automated PRs can
require a maintainer to select **Approve workflows to run** before CI starts; see
[GitHub's workflow-trigger rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow).
If needed, dispatch Python validation on the preparation branch with `publish=false`.
Merge the preparation PR only after validation succeeds.

## 2. Validate the merged release

Record the intended commit SHA and declared version. Both publishing workflows resolve `main` when dispatched;
the crates version input checks the version, but does not pin the commit. Inspect each run's commit before proceeding.
If `main` advances between runs, review and validate the additional changes rather than assuming the artifacts match.

From the GitHub Actions UI:

1. Run **Release crates** on `main`, enter the declared `version`, and leave `dry_run` checked.
2. Run **Release Python** on `main` with `publish` unchecked, or inspect the completed automatic validation for the
   same commit.

CLI equivalents:

```bash
gh workflow run release-crates.yml --ref main -f version="$release_version" -F dry_run=true
gh workflow run release-python.yml --ref main -F publish=false
```

The crates dry run checks versions, unused release refs, registry availability, lockfile consistency, formatting,
Clippy, and tests. It dry-runs publication of core and packages the server with a local core override and
`--no-verify`, because the new core version is not in the registry yet. It does not prove registry authentication or
perform a full server publication rehearsal against the registry.

Python validation builds these exact wheel variants, installs each wheel, and runs the Python tests and wheel checks:

| Platform | Wheel suffix |
| --- | --- |
| Linux x86_64 | `py3-none-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl` |
| macOS Intel | `py3-none-macosx_10_12_x86_64.whl` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl` |

Linux uses the pinned manylinux image with vendored OpenSSL and its Perl build prerequisites. The installed binary
must have no unresolved shared libraries or system `libssl`/`libcrypto` dependency. Keep this release matrix in CI
when changing packaging or toolchain configuration; a successful host build alone does not establish portability.

`pyproject.toml` points to `python/README.md` for the PyPI description. Review that README and project URLs before
publishing. The installed metadata test rejects an empty or non-Markdown description. To check downloaded artifacts
for rendering errors too, run `uvx --from twine twine check --strict /path/to/wheels/*.whl`.

## 3. Publish

After validation, use **Actions → Release crates → Run workflow** on `main`, enter the same version, and **uncheck
`dry_run`**. The workflow publishes core, waits for it to appear in the crates.io index, publishes the server, creates
`v<VERSION>` and its GitHub release, and invokes the website deployment. It currently publishes only
`agentic-server-core` and `agentic-server`.

Then use **Actions → Release Python → Run workflow** on `main` and **check `publish`**. There is no version field;
it reads the declaration in `Cargo.toml`. It checks that the version is unused, rebuilds and validates all three
wheels, then uploads exactly those artifacts from the same run. A successful earlier build-only run is not promoted
or reused. The Python workflow does not create the Git tag or GitHub release.

CLI equivalents (these upload packages):

```bash
gh workflow run release-crates.yml --ref main -f version="$release_version" -F dry_run=false
gh workflow run release-python.yml --ref main -F publish=true
```

Run the publication steps once each, following each run to completion before moving on. If one registry already has
the intended release, verify it and publish only to the remaining registry. Do not rerun the completed publication.

## 4. Verify availability and update install instructions

A green build job alone is not a release. Check the publishing job and the registry contents:

- Both crates are available at the intended version, and the `v<VERSION>` tag/GitHub release point to the expected SHA.
- The PyPI version has all three wheels listed above and the expected project description and links.
- Install from the registries in a clean environment and check the reported version:

```bash
uvx --from "agentic-api==$release_version" agentic --version
cargo install agentic-server --version "=$release_version" --locked --root /tmp/agentic-release-smoke
/tmp/agentic-release-smoke/bin/agentic-server --version
```

After publication is confirmed, update `PUBLISHED_VERSION` in `website/lib/quickstart.ts`, the matching install
examples in `website/public/llms.txt`, `website/README.md`, and `docs/guides/python-installation.md`, plus any pinned
README examples and static website assertions. Keep `python/README.md` accurate for the next Python release.
The crates workflow's website deployment does not edit these files or prove PyPI availability. Merge the website
changes and verify deployment before announcing the updated install instructions.

## Failed runs and duplicate versions

- **Build or test failure before upload:** fix it through a PR and rerun validation. Record the new commit; do not
  bypass checks to publish artifacts from a failed matrix.
- **Duplicate version:** publication must fail. Python rejects an existing PyPI version before building. Crates
  rejects an existing tag or either published crate version, including during dry runs. Python build-only runs can
  still validate an already published version. Never add `skip-existing` or remove these guards to make a run green.
- **Registry lookup failure:** only HTTP 404 counts as unused. Timeouts and other HTTP responses fail the run; they
  are not permission to publish.
- **Partial upload:** inspect the registry, job logs, uploaded artifacts, and source SHA first. A rerun can fail
  because one wheel or the core crate already exists. The workflows do not automatically resume partial releases;
  decide on a reviewed recovery or a new version instead of blindly redispatching or deleting registry files.
- **Tag, GitHub release, or website failure after crate upload:** the crates may already be published. Repair the
  remaining step after checking the registry and commit; do not restart package publication just to deploy the site.
- **Description or metadata correction after upload:** fix `pyproject.toml` or `python/README.md` and publish a new
  version. Existing wheel filenames cannot be replaced. Do not describe a merged metadata fix as live on PyPI.
